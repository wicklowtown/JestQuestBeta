The beta version of my project "JestQuest".
The game, initially conceptualised as a rhythm game / 2.D platformer / endless runner hybrid has been drastically scaled back due to my limited programming capabilities.
Developed with Unreal Engine 5.
The main tutorial used for the basis of my gameplay, outside of college lectures, was this tutorial series on YouTube: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5tI7Z2tI7yYKn4irjkTEeEyH0Kblzv6C&si=0nidBeEvTE5qpDm6

Below, I'll list every version I've pushed to this repository during development.

(the commits before Version 0.01 were merely for testing the revision control of the git.)

Version 0.01 - Added downloaded animations, new game mode (infinite runner) blueprint, added input mapping.

Version 0.02 - Added Jump, Move and Slide input controls. The character now endlessly runs forward, but the jump doesn't work.

Version 0.03 - Jumping fixed, sliding added.
