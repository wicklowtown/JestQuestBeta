The beta version of my project "JestQuest".
The game, initially conceptualised as a rhythm game / 2.D platformer / endless runner hybrid has been drastically scaled back to my limited programming capabilities.
Developed with Unreal Engine 5.
Below, I'll list every version I've pushed to this repository during development.

(the commits before Version 0.01 were merely for testing the revision control of the git.)

Version 0.01 - Added downloaded animations, new game mode (infinite runner) blueprint, added input mapping.
