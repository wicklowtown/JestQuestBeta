The beta version of my project "JestQuest".
The game, initially conceptualised as a rhythm game / 2.D platformer / endless runner hybrid has been drastically scaled back due to my limited programming capabilities. 
After a series of blunders with the alpha stage of my project, this game is entirely new and shares no files or content with my previous attempt at the game.
Files from that attempt can be found at https://github.com/wicklowtown/JestQuestAlphaRebuilt.

Developed with Unreal Engine 5.
The main tutorial used for the basis of my gameplay, outside of college lectures, was this tutorial series on YouTube: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5tI7Z2tI7yYKn4irjkTEeEyH0Kblzv6C&si=0nidBeEvTE5qpDm6

Below, I'll list every version I've pushed to this repository during development.

(the commits before Version 0.01 were merely for testing the revision control of the git.)

Version 0.01 - Added downloaded animations, new game mode (infinite runner) blueprint, added input mapping.

Version 0.02 - Added Jump, Move and Slide input controls. The character now endlessly runs forward, but the jump doesn't work.

Version 0.03 - Jumping fixed, sliding added.

Version 0.04 - The start of blueprints for floor generation is added. (unfinished)

Version 0.05 - Infinite floor generation (glitchy) but working.

Version 0.06 - Lane switching added - though moving right is currently broken.

Verion 0.07 - Minor fixes. Lane switching still broken.

Version 0.08 - Lane switching is somewhat fixed, although double tapping on either left or right causes the character to return to the centre lane.

Version 0.09 - Lane switching fixed.

Version 0.10 - Obstacles added. Player can dodge, duck and slide under very basic obstacles as they move towards them. Although there is an error as the right hand lane is empty. 

Version 0.11 - Ragdoll physics added if player hits into obstacle. Death added / death screen added, allowing players to choose to restart or quit when they die.

Version 0.12 - Scoreboard / high score system added.

Version 0.13 - Minor bug fixes, tweaking collisions with objects. Attempted to IK retarget my Jester mesh to that of a UE mannequin but was unsuccessful.

Version 0.14 - Jester Character IK retargeted to player. Slide animation not working.
